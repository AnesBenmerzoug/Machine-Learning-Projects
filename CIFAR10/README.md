# CIFAR-10 Network
A Neural Network used to classify the images of the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) Dataset.
The Network is a deep convolutional network inspired by the ones described in [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556). It contains 4 set of Convolutional and Batch Normalization layers followed by an ReLU non-linearity and then a MaxPool layer. The particular thing about this network is that it uses kernels of size 3x3 for the convolutions, which is very small. The output of the Network is a class conditional probability for the 10 classes in the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) Dataset using a softmax non-linearity.
